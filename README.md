# Widgets 101: Customizing and Creating Widgets with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

The ArcGIS API for JavaScript includes widgets that are building blocks for creating the UI for your GIS web apps. Learn how to take an out-of-the-box widget and customize it to your heart's content. Make a widget your own by restyling, theming, adding functionality, or replacing existing logic. We'll cover the programming pattern and new architecture of widgets, and how you can give your widget a face-lift using CSS. We will also discuss best practices and recommended tooling for widget development.
